# Football-Team-Management-website
A Web Development project which involves involves basic concepts of HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL.

This project was developed as a Web Technology project which I undertook in my 5th Semester, CSE course.
It was developed on a Linux Mint System, using the Apache2 server, the MySQL server and PHP 7 (or a LAMP setup).
The 'mysql_commands' file lists the MySQL commands you will have to execute on the terminal to create a database which acts as a back end storage for this website.
The 'OutputScreenshots' folder has the screen shots of various functionalities of the website.
For best results use the Google Chrome web browser.

Thank you.
